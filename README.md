<span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">
Welcome to the **Coffee Machine Simulator**! This project, developed during Dr. Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code" Bootcamp, simulates a coffee machine that allows users to select and pay for various coffee drinks while managing resources.

## <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">How It Works</span>

1. **Select a Drink**: Users can choose between espresso, latte, and cappuccino.
2. **Check Ingredients**: The machine verifies if there are enough ingredients.
3. **Process Payment**: Users insert coins, and the machine checks if the amount is sufficient.
4. **Prepare Coffee**: The machine prepares the coffee and updates the ingredient levels.

## <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Learning Outcomes</span>

Through this project, we have gained hands-on experience in:
- Writing clean and modular Python code.
- Managing state and resources within a program.
- Implementing simple user input and output mechanisms.
- Processing and validating user inputs.
